       <p id="text">In word processing and desktop publishing, a hard return or paragraph break indicates a new paragraph, to be distinguished from the soft retu
        rn at the end of a line internal to a paragraph. This distinction allows word wrap to automatically re-flow text as it is edited, without losing paragraph breaks. T
        he software may apply vertical white space or indenting at paragraph breaks, depending on the selected style. How such documents are actually stored depends on the f
        ile format. For example, HTML uses the tag as a paragraph container. In plaintext files, there are two common formats. The pre-formatted text will have a newline at 
        the end of every physical line, and two newlines at the end of a paragraph, creating a blank line. An alternative is to only put newlines at the end of each paragraph, 
        and leave word wrapping up to the application that displays or processes the text. A line break that is inserted manually, and preserved when re-flowing, may still be 
        distinct from a paragraph break, a lthough this is 
        typically not done in prose. HTML's tag produces a line break without ending the paragraph; the W3C recommends using it.</p>
